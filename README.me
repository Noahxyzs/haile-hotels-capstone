# 🏨 Haile Hotels & Resorts – Review Analytics and Sentiment Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive **sentiment analysis and topic modeling system** for online customer reviews of **Haile Hotels and Resorts**, one of Ethiopia’s leading hospitality brands. Using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** techniques, the project extracts actionable insights from unstructured review data and visualizes them through an **interactive dashboard**.

The primary goal is to demonstrate how data-driven review analytics can support **service quality improvement**, **customer satisfaction analysis**, and **evidence-based decision-making** in the Ethiopian hospitality industry.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Collect and preprocess online hotel reviews from multiple platforms
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on ratings and textual reviews
- Develop sentiment classification models using machine learning
- Identify key service areas through topic modeling
- Build a professional, interactive analytics dashboard
- Provide interpretable insights for hotel management

## 🗂️ Dataset Description

### 📥 Data Sources
- Online hotel review platforms (e.g., booking-related websites, social platforms)
- Public hotel review dataset from Kaggle (used for model enhancement)

### 📊 Dataset Structure
The final processed dataset includes:
- `hotel_name` – Name of the hotel or resort  
- `source` – Review platform  
- `rating_raw` – Original rating value  
- `rating_0_5` – Normalized rating (0–5 scale)  
- `review_comment` – Original customer review  
- `clean_full_text` – Preprocessed review text  
- `sentiment` – Classified sentiment (positive, neutral, negative)  
- `lda_topic` – Topic label from LDA topic modeling  

---

## 🧪 Methodology

### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Missing value handling
- Rating normalization
- Text cleaning (lowercasing, stopword removal, lemmatization)
- Feature preparation for NLP models

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Rating distributions
- Sentiment proportions
- Topic frequency analysis
- TF-IDF term importance analysis (used instead of word clouds for academic rigor)

### 3️⃣ Sentiment Analysis
- TF-IDF vectorization
- Machine learning classifiers:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Naïve Bayes
  - Random Forest
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

### 4️⃣ Topic Modeling
- Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
- Identification of dominant service-related topics
- Assignment of topic labels to reviews

---

## 📊 Dashboard
An interactive dashboard was developed using **Streamlit** to visualize:
- Key performance indicators (KPIs)
- Rating distributions
- Sentiment breakdowns
- Topic modeling results
- TF-IDF important terms by sentiment
- Review explorer
- Real-time sentiment prediction

### 📷 Dashboard Preview
Screenshots of the dashboard are available in:

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy**
- **scikit-learn**
- **NLTK, spaCy**
- **Plotly, Matplotlib**
- **Streamlit**
- **Git & GitHub**

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

### 1️⃣ Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

2️⃣ Run data preprocessing
python src/data/clean_reviews.py

3️⃣ Train models
python src/modeling/sentiment_pipeline.py
python src/modeling/topic_modeling.py

4️⃣ Launch the dashboard
streamlit run src/dashboard/streamlit_app.py

📈 Key Findings

Majority of reviews express positive sentiment, indicating strong customer satisfaction

Negative sentiments are primarily associated with specific service areas such as maintenance and connectivity

Topic modeling reveals recurring discussion themes related to rooms, staff behavior, food services, and cleanliness

TF-IDF analysis highlights discriminative terms contributing to sentiment classification

📌 Conclusion

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of NLP and machine learning techniques in extracting valuable insights from hotel customer reviews. The developed system provides a scalable framework for review analytics that can be adopted by Ethiopian hotels to improve service quality and customer experience.
